# Uandha Fernandes Barbosa Report

#Disclaimer:

It is important to highlight that in the final version I chose not to display the text prompt analysis to the user. This decision was made deliberately after sharing the app with testers. To act responsibly regarding the content users might read, I decided not to provide a “machine-based analysis,” as such interpretations could be disturbing or misleading. Also, given that I am not a mental health specialist, and since the app is designed as a playful, exploratory experience that still requires further refinement, I felt it was more appropriate to avoid presenting automated psychological interpretations to users.

If you would like to see the prompts on the website, please run the application locally using the previous version of the index.html file available on GitHub.

#Logical description for the dream interpreter development:

 1. The user selects one of two available languages: English or Brazilian Portuguese.
 2. The user chooses a color.
 3. The user writes a description of their dream and clicks on “Send My Dream.”
 4. The dream description and selected color are analyzed using the model gpt-4.1.
 5. The user receives:
   5.1 A playful comment generated in the selected language using gpt-4.1,
   5.2 The first image is generated by gpt-image-1, constructed based on a Jung-inspired color analysis and the 3 words input from text model gpt-4.1.
   5.3 A second image is generated by gpt-image-1-mini, using the dream interpretation produced by gpt-4.1 as input.
   5.4 The user has the option to download both generated images.
   5.5 Both images dynamically update and appear as part of the website’s background.





Minimal code for Flask app making calls to the OpenAI API


```
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv

# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages. For example
pip3 install flask openai python-dotenv

# Rename the file .env-bup to .env 
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file.

# Run the app
python3 app.py

## User interaction and interface Modification

#
2. The user enters a dream description in a text field.
3. Upon submission, the application generates:
   - a Jungian-style textual interpretation (to be implemented)
   - a symbolic image inspired by the dream (to be implemented)
4. Both outputs are displayed side by side in a visually framed layout.
5. Color Interpretation - Mandala analysis
