# Uandha Fernandes Barbosa Report

#Disclaimer:

It is important to highlight that in the final version I chose not to display the text prompt analysis to the user. This decision was made deliberately after sharing the app with testers. To act responsibly regarding the content users might read, I decided not to provide a “machine-based analysis,” as such interpretations could be disturbing or misleading. Also, given that I am not a mental health specialist, and since the app is designed as a playful, exploratory experience that still requires further refinement, I felt it was more appropriate to avoid presenting automated psychological interpretations to users.

If you would like to see the prompts on the website, please run the application locally using the previous version of the index.html file available on GitHub.

# 1.Logical description for the dream interpreter development:

 1.1 The user selects one of two available languages: English or Brazilian Portuguese.
 1.2 The user chooses a color.
 1.3 The user writes a description of their dream and clicks on “Send My Dream.”
 1.4 The dream description and selected color are analyzed using the model gpt-4.1.
 1.5 The user receives:
   5.1 A playful comment generated in the selected language using gpt-4.1,
   5.2 The first image is generated by gpt-image-1, constructed based on a Jung-inspired color analysis and the 3 words input from text model gpt-4.1.
   5.3 A second image is generated by gpt-image-1-mini, using the dream interpretation produced by gpt-4.1 as input.
   5.4 The user has the option to download both generated images.
   5.5 Both images dynamically update and appear as part of the website’s background.

# 2. Implementation of Jungian Ideas

 2.1 Prompt Engineering

   The prompt for the text model (GPT-4.1) wa engineered to:
   - Establish the model’s role as a “world-class Jungian psychiatrist.”
   - Provide a reference guide linking colors to psychological functions.
   - Provide a reference guide for dream interpretation based on Jung's thinking, intuition, feeling, and sensation. Also this line "assuming the dream aims to restore psychic    equilibrium"to force the model was into preservation of user's mental health.
   - Instruct the model to interpret both the dream narrative and the selected color.
   - Constrain the output format to exactly into 3 sections: a short, witty therapist-style interpretation, three evocative words representing the psychological state and the model's dream interpretation.
   - This formatting was intentional to ensured: predictable structure for parsing and clear separation between sections.

  The prompts for the image models (gpt-image-1 and gpt-image-1-mini) were engineered to:
  - Use the color psychological keywords (the second line of the text output) as the conceptual seed for visual abstraction.
  - Establish a artistic identity for each model (e.g., a surrealist artist influenced by poetic symbolism, and an Impressionist painter focused on emotional atmosphere).
  - Encourage symbolic rather than literal illustration of dream content.
  - Maintain low image quality settings to reduce latency and deployment instability.

 2.2 Prompt Engineering Improvements
   - More concise and assertive prompts.
   - Usage of stronger formatting rules.Example instructions such as:"Exactly 3 evocative words separated by comma+space."
   - Better use of models roles such as understanding how to properly use the example role into model behavior. 
   - Try short and controlled prompting: shorter, structured prompts produced more stable outputs than long philosophical instructions?

# 3. Technical Challenges

 3.1 Image Rendering Issues
  In some cases, generated images did not display in the browser. The main causes were: large images, and models type.

 3.2 Deployment Instability on Render
  When deployed on Render, the application occasionally crashed. The most common cause was timeout due to:
    - Sequential model calls (text + image).
    - Delays in hosted environments.
# 4. Insights Gained
  4.1 Prompt engineering is not just wording—it is system design.
  4.2 Clear role definition and output constraints significantly affect reliability.
  4.3 Image generation requires different prompt logic than text generation.
  4.4 Model latency, API behavior, and hosting limitations shape artistic and technical outcomes.

# From Class 04 Feb 2026 by Professor Dr.Gabriel Vigliensoni  Minimal code for Flask app making calls to the OpenAI API
```
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv

# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages. For example
pip3 install flask openai python-dotenv

# Rename the file .env-bup to .env 
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file.

# Run the app
python3 app.py
